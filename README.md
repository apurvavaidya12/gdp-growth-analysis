# GDP Growth Analysis & Forecasting (1980–1993)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes historical GDP growth data of selected Asian economies using Python.
The goal is to understand economic trends, stability, and forecast future growth using
trend-based methods.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: IMF historical GDP growth data
- Period: 1980–1993
- Countries analyzed: China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and transformation (wide → long format)
- Country-wise average growth and volatility analysis
- Identification of best and worst growth years
- Trend analysis using correlation
- 10-year GDP growth forecasting using linear trend extrapolation

## 📈 Key Insights
- Some economies show high average growth but also high volatility.
- Stable economies exhibit moderate growth with lower fluctuations.
- Trend-based forecasting provides a directional outlook for future growth.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Forecasting assumes historical trends continue.
- Does not account for policy changes, global crises, or external shocks.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add more countries and years
- Use advanced forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet)
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard
